#+TITLE: My dotfiles

* Docs
** Basics
This dotfiles repository uses rsync to sync the different configuration files from their locations into this directory. The reason why I chose to sync them into and not from the directory is because some programs like UltiSnips and Doom Emacs have their own ways to edit the config and it is hard to overwrite the location of those files. All the files and directories to be synced are in =sync_files.txt= and can be added via the command line using the =dots= command line utility.

** Installation
To install simply navigate to =~/.dotfiles= and execute =scripts/dots install=

*Note:* A backup of your old config will be created under =~/.dotfiles-old=
